# Introduction

We have visualised data on movies using R software. For this, we constructed a scatter plot for discrete X and Y values which include IMDB rating, critics score, MPAA rating, genre. We further assign same color to same type of points in scatter plot on the basis of a color by variable. We can also change the alpha value of the graph, 0 being transparent and 1 being opaque. The sizes of the points can be changed varying from a scale of 0 to 5. The UI consists of a main panel and side panel. The side panel takes input for the construction of the graph and main panel displays the corresponding scatter plot

# Dataset

The data represents 651 randomly sampled movies released between 1972 to 2014 in the United States. We use data from the movies dataset, which combines data from two websites: the Internet Movie Database, commonly known as IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes. The observations are a random sample of 651 movies released in the US between 1970 and 2014.
